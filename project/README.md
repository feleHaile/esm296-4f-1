#Relevance
#For the final project, I am interested in studying the Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) because of its large range in the Pacific Ocean and its implications for river and watershed management in the Pacific Northwest.  The main habitat variables that I can use in this analysis would be water temperature and dissolved oxygen content of the streams the salmon spawn in.  Another potential variable is the location of dams on rivers within the Salmons natural range. This could be used to illustrate the impacts of dams on habitat range.
